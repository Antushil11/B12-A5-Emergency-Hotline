2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
Answer: Creating and inserting a new element into the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript involves two main steps: creating the element and then adding it to an existing part of the DOM.
3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Answer: Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique for handling events where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to manage events triggered by its child elements. This approach leverages the concept of event bubbling, where an event triggered on a child element propagates up to its parent elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) tree
5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
